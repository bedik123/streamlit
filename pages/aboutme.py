            Sweat drips down my face as I bounce the basketball, the sound of my shoes squeaking on the gym floor. The gym is full of energy, with my friends cheering and the other team trying to block me. I move past defenders, focused on the hoop, my heart racing with excitement. As I get to the three-point line, I feel the excitement building. I throw the ball, watching it fly through the air and land perfectly in the net. The cheers from my friends fill me with happiness and pride.
